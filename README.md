tiny real time sensors' fusion towards IOT data agregator, RTOS collaborative dashboard with edge computing scenarios

# Real-Time Sensor Fusion Demo 🚀

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time embedded system that fuses data from multiple sensors (IMU, Temperature) using an RTOS environment (e.g., FreeRTOS).  
The goal is to provide robust, efficient sensor data integration for applications like UAVs, Industrial IoT, and Wearable Devices.
